Hbase powered feed aggregator
-----------------------------

WARNING: This is deprecated. It works only with HBase 0.19 and an older version of Apache Thrift. I will keep the repository here because I believe it's still useful as a proof-of-concept. 

Install guide
-------------

See INSTALL for detailed install steps.

Hbase schema
------------

The aggregator is using three tables:
 - `Feeds` - for storing raw feed and some limited metadata
 - `Urls` - for storing the extracted urls from the feeds
 - `UrlsIndex` - an index table used to generate the aggregated feed
